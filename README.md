notifiU

A Centralized University Communication & Engagement Web Platform

📌 Overview

notifiU is a web-based university communication and engagement platform designed to centralize academic updates, events, career opportunities, module information, and student support into a single structured system.

The platform reduces reliance on scattered communication channels such as emails, WhatsApp groups, LMS portals, and social media by providing a unified interface for students, lecturers, administrators, and external job providers.

notifiU addresses these issues through a centralized and structured system.
